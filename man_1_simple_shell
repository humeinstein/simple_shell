.SH NAME
hsh - Simple Shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR "hsh "[file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
hsh is an sh-compatible language interpreter that executes commands read from standard input.
hsh is intended to be an exact copy of Simple Shell with improvements regarding memory.
.SH ARGUMENTS
.PP
The first argument is the name of the file that should contain shell commands. hsh reads commands from the file and exits.
.SH COMMANDS
.PP
A line is read and if the first word of the line is not a reserved word, then the shell has recognized a simple command.
Otherwise a complex command has been recognized.
.SH SIMPLE COMMANDS
.PP
A simple command is one that is found in the environmental list.
.SH BUILTIN COMMANDS
.pp
cd              changes the current working directory to a given directory as an argument. If "cd -" is executed then go to previous directory. If cd is executed alone then go to home directory.
.PP
env             prints the environment from the environmental list.
.PP
Complex commands are a combination of control operators and simple commands.
    example: "ls ; ls"
.SH EXIT STATUS
.PP
Errors that are detected by the shell, such as a syntax error, will cause the shell to exit with a non-zero exit status. Otherwise the shell will return the exit status of the last command executed.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.PP
HOME       Set automatically by login(1) from the user's login directory in the password file (passwd(4)).  This environment variable also functions as the defaul
          argument for the cd builtin.
.PP
PATH       The default path for executables.
.PP
CDPATH     The search path used with the cd builtin.
.PP
PWD        Prints the current working directory.
.PP
OLDPWD     Users previous working directory.
.SH BUGS
.PP
There exist memory leaks.
